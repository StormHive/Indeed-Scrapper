Our mission is to make the retail economy of Pakistan radically more efficient.
Stores in Pakistan have been buying products in the same way for nearly a century. Why should 20 trucks deliver to the same store in a single day? Why do salespeople waste fuel to collect orders on scraps of paper? Why do store owners wait restlessly for someone to visit once a week to collect an order?
Tajir is a radical break from the past. We offer an app where stores can buy everything they need, delivered reliably the next day. We drastically reduce the number of vehicles on the road with efficient, centralized delivery, so both store owners and manufacturers enjoy higher profits. With $150B of purchases made by retailers annually, even modest efficiency gains have an outsized economic impact.
We are backed by Kleiner Perkins (early investors in Google, Amazon) and Y Combinator (early investors in Coinbase, Airbnb, Dropbox). Learn more about us on Forbes and Geo News.
What you’ll do
1) Deliver features to delight our customers. We are constantly pushing the boundaries on user experience, and we need a team of talented engineers to lead the way.
2) Write elegant code. The Tajir app grows increasingly complex and feature-rich. We can only manage because of our investments in software quality through strong architecture, code reviews, test driven development, and developer tooling. We expect new hires to join us in writing elegant, maintainable code.
3) Keep it simple. While there is intense pressure to ship more features, we must never compromise app stability, usability, and responsiveness. Your job is to defend the user experience!
What we are looking for
You are humble. You treat others with the same kindness, patience, and respect, regardless of seniority, class, or gender.
You have an extreme attention to detail. No imperfection escapes your discerning eyes.
You care deeply about writing beautiful code. You are tired of working on teams with spaghetti code.
You are excited at the chance to meet our customers, to learn from them and help us decide what to build next.
Requirements
1+ years of full-time experience of professional Android development (we seek all levels of experience, and will adjust our offer accordingly).
Nice to have
You have built something cool outside of university or professional life.
You have made a substantial contribution to open source code.
You have interviewed one of our customers in person (you'll find them in any market in Lahore).
Our tech stack
We do not screen candidates by their experience with a specific tech stack. If you are a great engineer, you can adopt any new tools easily!
That said, because everyone asks – our Android app is built with Java and Kotlin using an MVVM Clean architecture. Our back end is built with Python and Flask and deployed to Google Cloud as Docker images. We use PostgreSQL for transactional data, and BigQuery for analytical data."
